# QuestKeeper
### A Terminal Fantasy Adventure

---

## What Is It?

RPG fans want meaningful adventures they can play anywhere, anytime. But mobile games are shallow, and tabletop requires coordination.

**QuestKeeper fills that gap.**

A fantasy adventure with real RPG mechanics that runs offline and on any device. Real choices. Real consequences. Real imagination.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Three Campaigns** | Comedy, heroism, cosmic horror |
| **Real RPG Mechanics** | D&D-style skills, combat, equipment |
| **Runs Anywhere** | Terminal = laptop, server, phone via SSH |
| **Offline** | No WiFi required |
| **Save Anywhere** | Pick up where you left off |

## What Makes It Different?

Content creation requires zero code. YAML-driven campaigns mean anyone can build worlds.

That's not just a feature. That's a foundation for something bigger.

Fully tested, clean architecture, built to last.

## The Vision

A community marketplace where creators publish campaigns and players find their next adventure.

QuestKeeper becomes the engine. The community builds the content.
