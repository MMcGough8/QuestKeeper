name: "Muddlebrook: Harlequin Trials"
description: |
  A comedic mystery adventure set in the quirky town of Muddlebrook.
  The mayor has vanished, strange clockwork creatures roam the streets,
  and a theatrical villain known as the Harlequin Machinist pulls strings
  from the shadows. Navigate puzzle rooms, gather clues, and uncover
  the truth behind the chaos.

intro: |
  The evening at The Drunken Dragon Inn started like any other—warm
  firelight, the clink of tankards, and Norrin the bard's questionable
  singing filling the air.

  Then the doors BURST open.

  A breathless townsman stumbles in, mud-splattered and wide-eyed.

  "The mayor! Mayor Alderwick—he's GONE! Vanished from his office,
  locked from the inside! And there was... there was a NOTE. With a
  LAUGHING MASK drawn on it!"

  The tavern erupts in panicked whispers. Mara the bartender slams
  down a glass. "Everyone CALM DOWN."

  From the shadows of the corner booth, a hooded figure—Darius—rises
  slowly. His scarred hands grip the table edge.

  "It's him," Darius says, his voice like gravel. "The Harlequin
  Machinist. He's returned to Muddlebrook... and he's chosen his
  next players."

  His eyes find yours across the crowded room.

  "The question is: are YOU clever enough to survive his games?"

# Special notes for the DM/game engine
notes: |
  This campaign features theatrical puzzle rooms called "trials" that
  test different party abilities. Combat is secondary to investigation
  and puzzle-solving. The tone should be lighthearted with moments
  of genuine tension.
