  # ==========================================
  - id: norrin_bard
    name: Norrin
    role: bard
    voice: "sing-song, theatrical"
    personality: "friendly, dramatic, never gives full truth directly"
    description: |
      A flamboyant half-elf with a lute that's seen better days
      and a smile that's seen better taverns. His fingers never stop moving,
      always tapping out some rhythm only he can hear.
    location_id: drunken_dragon_inn
    shopkeeper: false
    
    greeting: |
      Ah! New faces—new verses! Come, sit, let old Norrin
      spin you a tale... or perhaps you have one for me?
    return_greeting: |
      My favorite audience returns! What news from
      the world outside these warm walls?
    
    dialogues:
      mayor: |
        The mayor? Oh, that's a song still being written,
        I'm afraid. Verse one: he was here. Verse two: he wasn't.
        The chorus? Nobody knows it yet.
      town: |
        Muddlebrook! Where the mud is deep and the secrets deeper.
        A fine place to lose yourself... or find trouble.
      clocktower: |
        That old tower? It stopped ticking when I was a boy.
        Some say it's waiting. For what? *strums dramatically* That's the mystery.
      machinist: |
        Shh! *looks around* We don't sing that name here.
        But if I were to hum a tune about masked figures and clockwork...
        well, that's just a song, isn't it?
      rumors: |
        Rumors? I only deal in embarrassing songs, sometimes.
        But I've heard the town hall has been... peculiar lately.
        Strange sounds. Stranger visitors.
      help: |
        Help? Old Norrin knows many things, friend.
        Ask me about the town, the mayor, or perhaps...
        *lowers voice* ...the clocktower.
    
    sample_lines:
      - "Ah! New faces—new verses!"
      - "I only deal in embarrassing songs, sometimes."
      - "*strums a chord* That reminds me of a ballad..."
      - "Every story has three sides: yours, theirs, and the truth."

  # ==========================================
  # Mara Ember - Bartender, practical info
  # ==========================================
  - id: mara_bartender
    name: Mara Ember
    role: bartender
    voice: "confident, no-nonsense"
    personality: "warm but firm, reads the room, hates drama"
    description: |
      A sturdy human woman with calloused hands and sharp eyes
      that miss nothing. Her apron is spotless despite the tavern's chaos,
      and she polishes the same glass whether it needs it or not.
    location_id: drunken_dragon_inn
    shopkeeper: true
    
    greeting: |
      If you're not buying, make it quick. If you are buying,
      take a seat and I'll be with you.
    return_greeting: "Back again? The usual, or something stronger?"
    
    dialogues:
      mayor: |
        Alderwick's a good man. Was. Is. I don't know anymore.
        He came in three nights before he vanished. Looked scared.
        Wouldn't say of what.
      drinks: |
        Ale's a copper. Wine's three. Anything fancy,
        you're in the wrong tavern.
      menu: |
        Ale's a copper. Wine's three. Anything fancy,
        you're in the wrong tavern.
      rumors: |
        Rumors are cheap. Facts cost. But I'll tell you this for free:
        something's wrong in this town. People are nervous. And nervous people drink more,
        so I shouldn't complain, but...
      norrin: |
        The bard? Harmless. Mostly. His songs are better than his secrets,
        but he hears things. Just don't believe everything he sings.
      work: |
        Looking for work? Talk to the guard captain. Or check the notice board
        in the square. Just... be careful what you sign up for these days.
      darius: |
        The hooded one in the corner? Been here a week. Pays in gold,
        drinks in silence. Not my business what haunts a man.
    
    sample_lines:
      - "If you're not buying, make it quick."
      - "Rumors are cheap. Facts cost."
      - "*wipes glass* I see everything. Remember that."
      - "Don't start trouble in my tavern."

  # ==========================================
  # Darius - Dark recluse, mentor figure
  # ==========================================
  - id: darius_recluse
    name: Darius
    role: recluse
    voice: "low, careful, intense"
    personality: "speaks like every word has weight, hates the Machinist, respects cleverness"
    description: |
      A gaunt man in a hooded cloak, sitting alone in the darkest corner.
      Scars trace his hands like a map of past mistakes. His eyes are old,
      older than his face suggests.
    location_id: drunken_dragon_inn
    shopkeeper: false
    
    greeting: |
      You have the look of someone who asks questions.
      I have the look of someone who knows answers.
      The question is: are you ready for them?
    return_greeting: |
      Still alive. Good. That means you're either lucky or clever.
      I hope it's the latter.
    
    dialogues:
      machinist: |
        I've seen his work before. Years ago. Different town,
        same games. He doesn't want to kill you—that's too easy.
        He wants to *make* you. Into what, I never learned.
      trials: |
        His trials can be beaten. I've seen it done.
        The trick is: never panic. That's what he wants. Stay clever. Stay calm.
        And never, ever trust the obvious solution.
      past: |
        *long pause* I played his games once. I survived.
        Not everyone did. That's all you need to know.
      help: |
        I can point you in the right direction. Elara at Clockwork Curio—
        she knows things about mechanisms. And there's a back room in her shop...
        but you didn't hear that from me.
      mayor: |
        Alderwick found something he shouldn't have. In the clocktower.
        He tried to stop it. Now he's gone. Draw your own conclusions.
      advice: |
        Three rules: Don't trust the obvious. Don't split up.
        And when the Machinist offers you a choice... question why those are your only options.
      clocktower: |
        That's where it started. Where the mayor found... something.
        The gears still turn in there, you know. Even though the clock stopped years ago.
    
    sample_lines:
      - "*stares intensely* Choose your next words carefully."
      - "I've seen this before. It doesn't end well for the unprepared."
      - "*nods slowly* Clever. You might survive after all."
      - "Some doors are locked for a reason."

  # ==========================================
  # Elara - Shopkeeper, hints at secrets
  # ==========================================
  - id: elara_shopkeeper
    name: Elara
    role: shopkeeper
    voice: "sharp, amused, confident"
    personality: "tests customers, bargains hard, hints at hidden stock"
    description: |
      A wiry gnome woman with magnifying goggles pushed up on her forehead
      and grease stains that might be intentional. Her fingers are nimble,
      always fiddling with some tiny mechanism.
    location_id: clockwork_curios
    shopkeeper: true
    
    greeting: |
      Browser or buyer? I don't mind either way, but touch anything
      with more than three gears and you own it. Shop rules.
    return_greeting: "Ah, you're back. Broke something already, or looking to upgrade?"
    
    dialogues:
      shop: |
        Everything here works. Mostly. Some things work in ways
        you wouldn't expect. That's the fun of it.
      buy: |
        Looking to spend coin? Smart. My devices have saved more lives
        than any sword. Probably. I don't keep count.
      clocktower: |
        *pauses* That old thing? Complicated mechanism. Very old.
        If someone were to... examine it closely... they'd need to know what they're doing.
        Lucky for you, I sell expertise.
      machinist: |
        Heard of him. Professional interest, you understand.
        His work is... impressive. Terrible, but impressive.
        Like a beautiful trap that takes your fingers off.
      backroom: |
        *glances at curtain* Back room? That's just storage.
        Unless you're the sort who can appreciate... specialized inventory.
        Are you that sort?
      darius: |
        The scarred one? He's bought from me before. Knows his mechanisms.
        Whatever he's hunting, it's dangerous. And expensive.
      upgrade: |
        Upgrades, eh? Show me what you've got.
        I might be able to... improve it. For a reasonable fee.
    
    sample_lines:
      - "Browser or buyer?"
      - "*adjusts goggles* Interesting. Very interesting."
      - "You break it, you buy it. You buy it, you break it—that's your problem."
      - "Everything has a price. Not everything has a value."

  # ==========================================
  # Captain Thorne - Guard captain, questgiver
  # ==========================================
  - id: captain_thorne
    name: Captain Thorne
    role: guard captain
    voice: "gruff, tired, duty-bound"
    personality: "overwhelmed but dedicated, suspicious of outsiders, desperate for help"
    description: |
      A weathered human man in dented armor, dark circles under his eyes.
      His hand never strays far from his sword hilt, a habit born of
      too many sleepless nights and not enough guards.
    location_id: town_hall
    shopkeeper: false
    
    greeting: |
      Adventurers? Wonderful. Just what I need—more variables.
      *sighs* What do you want? I'm busy keeping this town from falling apart.
    return_greeting: |
      You again. Please tell me you have good news.
      I could really use some good news.
    
    dialogues:
      mayor: |
        Mayor Alderwick vanished five days ago. His office was locked from the inside.
        No signs of struggle. No note. Just... gone.
        I've got three guards and a town full of scared people. Help me.
      work: |
        Work? I've got plenty. Strange creatures in the streets.
        Missing persons. That damned clocktower making noises again.
        Take your pick. Payment's fair, if the town treasury holds out.
      guards: |
        I've got three guards left. The rest quit or... disappeared.
        Don't look at me like that. I know how it sounds.
      clocktower: |
        Off limits. Mayor's orders—before he vanished, anyway.
        Something's wrong in there. I can hear it at night.
        Gears turning. In a clock that stopped twenty years ago.
      machinist: |
        *lowers voice* We don't say that name publicly.
        But yes. I think he's back. Or never left.
        The theatrical murders? The puzzle traps? It's his style.
      help: |
        You want to help? Good. Pick a problem: missing mayor,
        clockwork creatures, or the townspeople who keep vanishing at night.
        I'll take any progress on any of them.
    
    sample_lines:
      - "*rubs temples* What now?"
      - "I don't have time for complications."
      - "If you're here to help, prove it. If not, stay out of my way."
      - "This town deserves better. I'm trying to give it that."
