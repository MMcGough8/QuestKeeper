intro: |
  The sea gives, and the sea takes.

  For three centuries, the city of Saltmire has prospered. Built on the bones of
  an ancient civilization that sank beneath the waves long before human memory,
  the city harvests relics from the Sunken Ruins—artifacts of impossible beauty
  and terrible power that fetch fortunes in distant markets.

  The Salvage Guild grows rich. The Tidekeepers maintain the ancient wards that
  keep the waters calm and the things below... quiet. The noble houses of the
  Abyssal Court trade in secrets and influence. And the common folk live their
  lives on wooden walkways above the ever-present sea, trying not to think about
  what lies beneath.

  But something has changed.

  Three weeks ago, the Prophet Mira—beloved oracle of the Tidekeepers, voice of
  the sea itself—descended into the deepest ruins on a sacred pilgrimage. She
  returned... different. Her eyes hold depths that weren't there before. Her
  smile carries secrets that make strong men weep. And she speaks of a coming
  tide that will "lift all souls to salvation."

  The waters are rising. Each night, the tide climbs higher than the night before.
  Districts that have been dry for generations now flood at moonrise. And in the
  dark hours, people hear it—a sound like singing, coming from beneath the waves.

  Those who listen too long... walk into the sea.

  You arrived in Saltmire seeking fortune, adventure, or answers. What you found
  was a city drowning in its own secrets, a prophet who speaks with the voice of
  something ancient, and the growing certainty that the sea has noticed you.

  The Drowned God is waking.

  And it is hungry.

  CAMPAIGN PILLARS:
  - Combat: HIGH (deadly encounters, intelligent enemies)
  - Exploration: VERY HIGH (underwater dungeons, hidden areas)
  - Social/RP: VERY HIGH (faction intrigue, moral dilemmas)

  CORE THEME: "What would you sacrifice to save what you love?"

  TONE: Gothic horror meets cosmic horror meets nautical adventure
  - Think: Curse of Strahd meets Call of Cthulhu meets Ghosts of Saltmarsh
  - The villain (Prophet Mira) should be PRESENT throughout, not just at the end
  - She genuinely believes she's saving humanity from a worse fate
  - Make players question whether she might be right

  THE DROWNED GOD:
  Not a deity in the traditional sense—an entity from beyond the stars that fell
  into the ocean eons ago. It doesn't want worship; it wants to MERGE with all
  consciousness, creating a collective existence beneath the waves. Is this evil?
  Or just... different?

  VILLAIN PRESENCE (like Strahd):
  - Prophet Mira should appear in EVERY act
  - Act 1: Helpful mentor figure, slightly unsettling
  - Act 2: Warnings become threats, her true nature shows
  - Act 3: Full antagonist, but still believes she's the hero
  - She KNOWS the players, watches them through water, speaks in dreams

  FACTION DYNAMICS:
  - Salvage Guild: Profit-driven, will work with anyone
  - Tidekeepers: Religious order, some corrupted, some fighting back
  - Abyssal Court: Nobles who've made deals with deep things
  - The Drowned: Mira's cult (hidden initially, revealed mid-campaign)
  - Lighthouse Keepers: Monster hunters, potential allies

  RISING STAKES MECHANIC:
  Track "Flood Level" from 1-10. It increases each session:
  - Level 1-3: Lower districts flood at night
  - Level 4-6: Middle districts flood, creatures appear
  - Level 7-9: Upper districts threatened, mass panic
  - Level 10: The Drowned God fully awakens

  MULTIPLE ENDINGS:
  1. Destroy the Drowned God (requires great sacrifice)
  2. Seal it away (temporary, buys time for future generations)
  3. Bargain with it (what price is too high?)
  4. Join it (the "bad" ending... or is it?)
  5. Let Saltmire fall (save who you can, flee)

  LEGENDARY ITEM DISTRIBUTION:
  - Tarrasque Plate: Final dungeon reward
  - Glaive of the Revenant King: Abyssal Court questline
  - Bolide Blade: Lighthouse Keepers questline
  - Mourningsteel Half Plate: Drowned temple reward

  DIFFICULTY EXPECTATIONS:
  - DCs should be 15+ for most challenges
  - Enemies use tactics, target weak points
  - Resources matter—no long rests in dangerous areas
  - Death is possible; resurrection draws the God's attention

  REPLAYABILITY:
  - Faction allegiance changes available paths
  - Prophet Mira's origin has three possible truths
  - The Drowned God's nature can be interpreted multiple ways
  - Different endings based on choices AND relationships
