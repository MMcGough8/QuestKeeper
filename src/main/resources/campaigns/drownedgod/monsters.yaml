  # THE DROWNED - Transformed Cultists
  # ==========================================
  - id: drowned_convert
    name: Drowned Convert
    description: |
      Once human, now something else. They willingly walked into the sea
      and emerged changed—gills splitting their necks, skin taking on a
      grey-blue pallor, eyes grown large and dark. They still remember
      being human. They pity those who haven't ascended yet.

        description: "When reduced to 0 HP, smiles peacefully. Last words are always 'The sea... welcomes...' This can be unsettling."

    tactics: |
      Drowned Converts prefer to grapple and drag targets toward water.
      They fight without fear or self-preservation—death holds no terror
      for those who have already drowned once.

  # DEPTH HORROR - Deep Sea Predator
  # ==========================================
  - id: depth_horror
    name: Depth Horror
    description: |
      Something that evolved in the lightless depths where pressure would
      crush steel and cold would freeze blood. Now they rise to serve the
      Drowned God, bringing the darkness of the abyss with them.

    tactics: |
      Depth Horrors use their lure to incapacitate targets, then grapple
      and drag them into deep water where the Horror has every advantage.
      They flee from bright light but return when it dims.

  # TIDEBOUND REVENANT - Undead Drowned
  # ==========================================
  - id: tidebound_revenant
    name: Tidebound Revenant
    description: |
      The corpse of someone who drowned fighting the sea's call—their
      refusal powerful enough to bind them to the mortal world as undead.
      They hate the Drowned God with a fury that transcends death.
    size: medium
    type: undead
    alignment: chaotic neutral

    armor_class: 15

        attack_bonus: 6
        damage: 2d6+3

        damage: 2d8
        damage_type: necrotic

      - name: Memory of Drowning
        description: "Can spend action to force one creature within 30 feet to experience drowning. DC 14 Wisdom save or be frightened and unable to speak for 1 minute."

    tactics: |
      Revenants target Drowned Converts and other sea-creatures first,
      ignoring other threats. They can be reasoned with if offered help
      against the Drowned God, but their hatred makes them unpredictable.

  # ==========================================
  # ABYSSAL NOBLE - Transformed Aristocrat
  # ==========================================
  - id: abyssal_noble
    name: Abyssal Noble
    description: |
      A member of the Abyssal Court whose family bargains have begun to
      show. They retain their intelligence and charm, but their bodies
      have started becoming something else—something older.

      - name: Crushing Depths
        attack_bonus: 7
        damage: 3d8
        damage_type: force
        description: "Calls upon the pressure of the deep. 20-foot radius, DC 15 Constitution save for half damage. Creatures that fail are knocked prone."

    special_abilities:
      - name: Amphibious
        description: "Can breathe air and water."
      - name: Court Intrigue
        description: "Advantage on Insight and Deception checks."
      - name: Depth Touched
        description: "Resistant to cold and psychic damage."
      - name: Commanding Presence
        description: "Can use bonus action to command Drowned Converts within 60 feet to attack specific target."
      - name: Noble Escape
        description: "When reduced below 20 HP, can teleport to nearest body of water within 60 feet as reaction."

    tactics: |
      Abyssal Nobles prefer to command others to fight while they stay at
      range, using Crushing Depths to control the battlefield. They will
      negotiate rather than fight to the death—their immortality depends
      on survival.

  # ==========================================
  # REEF LEVIATHAN - Boss Monster
  # ==========================================
  - id: reef_leviathan
    name: Reef Leviathan
    description: |
      A massive creature that has made the sunken ruins its territory.

      previous victims. It has guarded these waters for millennia.

      wisdom: 12
      charisma: 8

    challenge_rating: 10

    attacks:
      - name: Bite
        attack_bonus: 11
        damage: 4d10+7
        damage_type: piercing
        description: "A maw large enough to swallow a horse."

      - name: Tail Sweep
        attack_bonus: 11
        damage: 3d8+7
        damage_type: bludgeoning
        description: "Hits all creatures in 20-foot cone. DC 18 Strength save or be knocked back 15 feet and prone."

      - name: Reef Breath
        attack_bonus: 0
        damage: 6d6
        damage_type: slashing
        description: "Exhales a cloud of razor-sharp coral fragments. 60-foot cone, DC 17 Dexterity save for half."

    special_abilities:
      - name: Coral Armor
        description: "Resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks."
      - name: Ancient Predator
        description: "Has blindsight 120 feet and tremorsense 60 feet."
      - name: Living Reef
        description: "Small creatures can hide in its coral-encrusted body. The Leviathan has advantage on saves against being charmed or frightened."
      - name: Legendary Resistance
        description: "3/day, can choose to succeed on a failed saving throw."

    legendary_actions:
      - name: Tail Attack
        description: "Makes one tail sweep attack."
      - name: Detect
        description: "Makes a Perception check."
      - name: Coral Explosion
        description: "(Costs 2 actions) 20-foot radius around the Leviathan. All creatures must make DC 17 Dexterity save or take 2d10 piercing damage."

    tactics: |
      The Reef Leviathan is territorial, not malicious. It can be avoided
      through stealth or distracted with offerings of food. Fighting it
      directly is extremely dangerous—it should be an obstacle, not an
      enemy, unless players insist on confrontation.

  # ==========================================
  # HERALD OF THE DEEP - Mini-Boss
  # ==========================================
  - id: herald_of_the_deep
    name: Herald of the Deep
    description: |
      A prophet's prophet—one who touched the Drowned God directly and
      became its voice. It no longer has a human form, but it still has
      a human mind, trapped and screaming inside an alien shell.
    size: large
    type: aberration
    alignment: neutral evil

    armor_class: 16
    hit_points: 150
    speed: 30
    swim_speed: 60

    abilities:
      strength: 18
      dexterity: 14
      constitution: 18
      intelligence: 16
      wisdom: 18
      charisma: 20

    challenge_rating: 8

    attacks:
      - name: Mind Lash
        attack_bonus: 8
        damage: 3d8+5
        damage_type: psychic
        description: "A tendril of pure thought that tears at sanity."

      - name: Crushing Coils
        attack_bonus: 7
        damage: 2d10+4
        damage_type: bludgeoning
        description: "Constricting appendages. Target is grappled (escape DC 16). While grappled, target takes 2d10 bludgeoning at start of each turn."

    special_abilities:
      - name: Amphibious
        description: "Can breathe air and water."
      - name: Voice of the Deep
        description: "All creatures within 60 feet who can hear must make DC 16 Wisdom save at start of their turn or be charmed until the start of their next turn."
      - name: Prophet's Insight
        description: "Can read surface thoughts of any creature within 30 feet. Knows when it's being lied to."
      - name: Death Wish
        description: "The human consciousness trapped inside actively helps enemies. Twice per fight, will telegraph its next action to one player (DM's choice)."
      - name: Regeneration
        description: "Regains 10 HP at the start of its turn if it is in water."

    tactics: |
      The Herald relies on its Voice to turn enemies against each other.
      It prioritizes spellcasters and anyone who seems resistant to its
      charms. The trapped human inside occasionally sabotages its own
      attacks—this is intentional, not a mistake.

  # ==========================================
  # THE DROWNED GOD'S AVATAR - Final Boss
  # ==========================================
  - id: drowned_god_avatar
    name: Avatar of the Drowned God
    description: |
      Not the Drowned God itself—that entity is beyond mortal combat—but
      a fraction of its consciousness given form. Even this fragment is
      terrible beyond imagining, beautiful beyond description, and hungry
      beyond measure.
    size: huge
    type: aberration
    alignment: neutral

        attack_bonus: 11
        damage: 4d8+6
        damage_type: psychic
        description: "Tendrils of un-light that reach from impossible angles."

      - name: Drowning Gaze
        attack_bonus: 0
        damage: 6d8
        damage_type: cold
        description: "Targets one creature. DC 18 Charisma save or take damage and be paralyzed until end of next turn as they experience the peace of drowning."

      - name: Call of the Deep
        attack_bonus: 0
        damage: 0
        damage_type: psychic
        description: "All creatures within 120 feet must make DC 18 Wisdom save. Failure: creature must use movement to approach the Avatar and cannot willingly attack it for 1 minute. Repeat save at end of each turn."

    special_abilities:
      - name: Alien Physiology
        description: "Immune to cold, psychic, and poison damage. Resistant to all other damage from nonmagical sources."
      - name: Aura of Pressure
        description: "All creatures within 30 feet have disadvantage on Strength and Constitution saves."
      - name: Legendary Resistance
        description: "3/day can choose to succeed on a failed save."
      - name: The Sea Remembers
        description: "Can cast scrying at will without components, but only on creatures who have been submerged in seawater."
      - name: Willing Sacrifice
        description: "If a creature willingly dies within 30 feet of the Avatar, the Avatar regains 50 HP."

    legendary_actions:
      - name: Tendril Strike
        description: "Makes one Void Tendril attack."
      - name: Whisper
        description: "Targets one creature within 60 feet. DC 18 Wisdom save or be frightened until end of next turn."
      - name: Tidal Surge
        description: "(Costs 2 actions) All creatures within 30 feet must make DC 18 Strength save or be pushed 20 feet and knocked prone."
      - name: Moment of Peace
        description: "(Costs 3 actions) Targets one creature within 60 feet. DC 18 Charisma save or be charmed indefinitely, believing they have achieved perfect peace. Repeat save when taking damage."

    tactics: |
      The Avatar cannot be truly killed—only driven back. When reduced to
      0 HP, it dissolves into the sea, buying time but not ending the threat.
      To truly defeat it, players must use the ancient sealing ritual, make
      a bargain, or find another creative solution. Raw combat is not the
      answer.

    lair_actions: |
      On initiative count 20, the Avatar can take one of the following lair
      actions while in water:
      - Water in a 30-foot radius becomes difficult terrain
      - One creature must make DC 16 Wisdom save or see visions of peace
      - The water level rises by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet)
