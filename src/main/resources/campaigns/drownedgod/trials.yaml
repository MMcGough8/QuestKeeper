    location_id: flooded_underdock

    entry_narrative: |
      The entrance to the Underdock yawns before you—a dark throat leading
      down into flooded chambers that haven't seen light in decades. The
      smell of brine and rot rises on cold air. Somewhere below, water
      laps against stone with a rhythm that sounds almost like breathing.

      "No one goes down there anymore," Nessa says, checking her equipment.
      "Not since the Prophet returned. Things have been... moving. But if
      you want answers, this is where they're buried."

      She hands you a Third Lung Bag. "You'll need this. The lower chambers
      are completely submerged. And if you hear singing—" She doesn't finish.

      You begin your descent into darkness.

      As you surface from the Underdock, gasping air, you realize the tide
      has risen significantly while you were below. Water laps at walkways
      that were dry when you entered.

      And there, standing at the dock's edge, is Prophet Mira.

      "You survived," she says, and there's genuine warmth in her voice.
      "I knew you would. The sea shows me potential, and you have so much
      of it." She tilts her head. "What you found down there is just the
      beginning. The ruins go deeper. The truth goes deeper. When you're
      ready to see it all... come find me."

      She steps backward off the dock—and vanishes into the water without
      a splash, without a ripple, as if the sea simply absorbed her.

  # Lighthouse Keepers faction questline

  - id: trial_keepers
    name: "Trial of the Flame"
    location_id: lighthouse_beacon

    entry_narrative: |
      Commander Storm leads you to the beacon chamber, where the sacred
      flame flickers in its ancient brazier. The light that has protected
      Saltmire for three centuries is visibly weakening—guttering like a
      candle in wind.

      "The flame feeds on something in the ruins," Storm explains. "A
      crystal. A heart. We don't know exactly. Our founders took that
      knowledge to their graves." She hands you a map covered in their
      notes. "This is everything we know about where it might be."

      She meets your eyes. "The Court knows about the crystal too. So do
      the Tidekeepers—or what's left of them. You'll have competition.
      And the things in the deep... they don't want the light renewed."

      "Find the Flame Heart. Bring it back. Save Saltmire. Simple."

      Her smile is grim. "Nothing in Saltmire is simple anymore."

    stinger: |
      The Flame Heart pulses in your hands as you return to the lighthouse.
      It's warm—alive, somehow, in a way that defies explanation. When you
      place it in the brazier, the sacred flame ROARS to life, brighter
      than it's been in years.

      For a moment, all of Saltmire is bathed in golden light.

      Then the screaming starts. From the water. Hundreds of voices,
      crying out as the light burns them. You see shapes thrashing in
      the harbor—Drowned, caught in the open when the flame renewed.

      Commander Storm watches grimly. "We bought time. But they'll adapt.
      They always adapt." She clasps your shoulder. "Thank you. Whatever
      happens next... the Keepers won't forget this."

      In the distance, you see Prophet Mira standing on the Temple's
      highest spire. Even from here, you can tell she's smiling.

  - id: trial_court
    name: "The Deepholm Descent"
    location_id: deepholm_manor

    entry_narrative: |
      Lord Deepholm's smile shows too many teeth as he leads you into the
      depths of his manor. Below the elegant ballrooms and silk-draped
      chambers lies something else—passages carved from living coral, lit
      by bioluminescent growths, leading down into waters that have never
      seen the sun.

      "My family's true wealth lies below," he explains. "Treasures beyond
      imagination. Power beyond mortal understanding. All freely given by
      our... patrons... in the deep." His eyes flash in the darkness.

      "We need something retrieved. Something we gave as payment long ago
      that we now require returned. A glaive. Elven-made. It belonged to
      someone who tried to destroy what we serve." His voice hardens.
      "Retrieve it, and I'll give you what you need to reach the Drowned
      God's heart. Refuse... and you'll discover how deep our influence
      runs in Saltmire."

      Behind you, the passage seals. You're committed now.

    completion_reward_text: "Depth Key of Pressure"

    stinger: |
      You surface in the Deepholm grotto, the Glaive of the Revenant King
      heavy in your hands. The blade whispers warnings—it knows where it
      is. It knows what these people are.

      Lord Deepholm claps slowly. "Magnificent. You've exceeded our
      expectations." He extends his hand for the glaive.

      The blade grows warm. "Do not," it whispers. "They will use it to
      silence the last voices that oppose the deep."

      This is a choice. Give Deepholm the glaive and earn his trust—along
      with the Depth Key you need. Or keep it, make an enemy of the Court,
      and find another way.

      Lord Deepholm's smile doesn't waver. "Well? We had an arrangement."

      What do you do?

  - id: trial_prophet
    name: "Whispers in the Temple"
    location_id: tidekeeper_crypts

    entry_narrative: |
      Elder Vorn's hands shake as he leads you into the crypts beneath
      the Temple. The air is thick with salt and something else—a presence
      that presses against your mind like deep water.

      "Mira kept a journal," he says. "From before. She documented
      everything—her visions, her doubts, what she found in the ruins."
      He pauses at a sealed door. "It's in her old chambers, beyond the
      crypts. But the dead walk there now. My brothers and sisters who
      couldn't resist her call."

      He presses something into your hands. A silver key, warm to the
      touch. "This will open her chambers. The journal will show you
      what she was before. And maybe—maybe—it will show you how to reach
      whatever's left of the woman I raised."

      Behind him, something moves in the darkness. Many somethings.

      "Run," he says. "I'll hold them as long as I can. Find the truth.
      SAVE HER."

      The journal tells a story of faith, dedication, and slow corruption.
      Mira heard the voice of the deep for years before she descended. She
      thought she could understand it. Study it. Use it to protect Saltmire.

      She was wrong.

      The last entry reads: "I understand now. It doesn't want slaves. It
      wants family. It's so lonely in the dark. So hungry for connection.
      How can I refuse something that just wants to love?"

      A tear falls on the page. Not yours.

      Prophet Mira stands behind you, her eyes glistening. "Now you know,"
      she says softly. "I'm not a monster. I'm a missionary. And the thing
      I serve isn't evil—it's just... different. Alien. Alone."

      She reaches out, and for a moment, she looks entirely human.

      "Help me save everyone. Or stop me. But at least now you understand
      why I have to try."

  # Trial 5: The Drowning Heart (Final)
  # Confrontation with the Drowned God
  # ==========================================
  - id: trial_final
    name: "The Drowning Heart"
    location_id: the_drowning_heart

    entry_narrative: |
      Three keys. Three doors. And then... nothing.

      You descend through passages that twist in ways that hurt to think
      about, past murals depicting the history of a civilization that chose
      to drown, through waters that grow colder and darker with every stroke.

      And then you emerge into the Drowning Heart.

      The chamber is vast beyond measure. At its center, something floats—
      a presence so large and so wrong that your mind refuses to fully
      perceive it. Eyes that contain galaxies. Tendrils that stretch into
      dimensions you can't name. A voice that is all voices, speaking words
      that bypass your ears entirely.

      "YOU CAME."

      Prophet Mira rises from the darkness, fully transformed now—beautiful
      and terrible, human and other, suspended between what she was and
      what she's becoming.

      "It's time to choose," she says. "Join us, and know peace forever.
      Fight us, and drown alone. Or..." Her human eyes flicker. "...find
      another way. If you can."

      The Drowned God waits.

      The choice is yours.

      [This varies based on player choice]

      ENDING 1 - SEAL: The ancient ritual tears at your soul as you pour
      everything you have into the binding. The Drowned God screams—and
      sleeps again. Saltmire is saved. But the sea remembers. It always
      remembers.

      ENDING 2 - BARGAIN: The deal is struck. Saltmire survives, but changed.
      The sea gives, and the sea takes. What rises from the depths is neither
      salvation nor damnation—just different. Some will adapt. Some won't.
      Life continues.

      ENDING 3 - DESTROY: With the Prophet's Tear and the Glaive of the
      Revenant King, you strike at something that should be immortal. The
      Drowned God dies—but so does something else. The magic drains from
      Saltmire. The relics turn to dust. What's left is just a city on the
      water, ordinary and mortal.

      ENDING 4 - ASCEND: You let go. The water takes you. And in the
      darkness, in the pressure, in the silence... you find peace. You
      find connection. You find the family the Drowned God promised. Was
      it worth it? Only you know.

      ENDING 5 - FLEE: Sometimes wisdom is knowing when you can't win. You
      take who you can and run. Saltmire falls behind you, but you survive.
      Others survive. That has to be enough. The Drowned God will spread
      eventually. But not today. Not you.
