  - id: prophet_mira
    name: Prophet Mira
    short_descriptor: "a woman whose eyes hold the depths of the sea"
    description: |
      Once the most beloved oracle in Saltmire, Prophet Mira descended into the
      deepest ruins three weeks ago and returned... changed. She speaks with a
      voice that echoes, moves as if underwater even on dry land, and her eyes
      reflect things that shouldn't exist. She genuinely believes she is saving
      humanity from a worse fate. She may even be right.
    personality: serene, maternal, terrifying, sympathetic, absolutely certain
    voice: "Layered and echoing, as if many voices speak in perfect unison. Warm but unsettling."
    role: main_villain

    greeting: |
      The Prophet turns to face you, and for a moment—just a moment—you see
      something vast and ancient looking out through her eyes.

      "Ah. You've come." Her smile is warm. Her voice resonates in your chest.
      "I've been watching you. The sea shows me things now. It showed me you.
      It showed me what you might become... if you're brave enough to let go."

        response: |
          "The sea is not cruel. It simply is. It takes, yes—but it also gives.
          Shelter from the burning sky. Peace from the chaos above. Connection
          to something greater than ourselves." Her eyes grow distant. "I heard
          it calling for so long before I finally answered. The silence. The
          belonging. You hear it too, don't you? In the quiet moments?"

        response: |
          "God is a human word for something beyond human understanding. What
          sleeps beneath Saltmire is not a god—it is a possibility. A way of
          being. It fell from the stars eons ago and found the ocean welcoming.
          It does not want worship." She tilts her head. "It wants connection.
          Union. An end to the loneliness of individual existence. Is that
          so terrible?"

        keywords: [changed, different, transformation, what happened to you]
        response: |
          "I touched it. Just once. Just for a moment." Her voice softens.
          "And I understood everything. The fear, the struggle, the desperate
          clinging to separate existence—all of it unnecessary. There is peace
          in the depths. There is belonging." She reaches toward you, and you
          notice her fingers have begun to web. "I want to share that peace
          with everyone. Is that not what prophets do?"

        response: |
          *She looks at you with something like pity*
          "You could try. Others have. But you cannot fight the tide—only
          delay it. And every moment you delay, more people suffer alone in
          their separate skins." She sighs. "I was afraid too, once. But fear
          is just another form of drowning—slower and more cruel. Let me show
          you a better way."

      bargain:
        keywords: [deal, bargain, negotiate, compromise, agreement]
        response: |
          *Her eyes flicker with something ancient*
          "The deep remembers all bargains. The nobles of the Abyssal Court
          learned this long ago—and have prospered for it. You could join them.
          Serve the rising tide and be spared its worst... or stand against it
          and drown in the old way." She smiles. "There are no neutral parties
          in the sea. Only the swimming and the sinking."

      Former salvage diver turned tavern keeper. Lost his eye—and his crew—

    role: ally

    greeting: |
      The old sailor looks up from his glass, his one good eye narrowing.

      "New faces. That's rare these days—most folk are leaving, not arriving."
      He gestures to a seat. "Sit. Drink. And tell me what brings you to a

          He drinks. "The tides rise higher each night. Folk are disappearing.
          And that singing you hear at night? Don't listen. Don't ever listen."

          who pays, but be careful—Guildmaster Vex has made bargains of her
          own." He leans in. "There might be a way to seal it back up. The

          to drown. But I've been drowning in guilt for twenty years, and
          I'm still here fighting." He meets your eye. "The future isn't

      The most powerful merchant in Saltmire. She's made the Salvage Guild

    greeting: |
      The Guildmaster looks up from a ledger filled with numbers that seem
      to writhe on the page.

      "New contractors? Or just tourists?" Her smile is sharp. "Either way,
      you're in the right place. The Guild can provide anything you need—
      information, equipment, access to the ruins. All it costs is gold.
      And occasionally, other things."

    greeting: |
      The Commander doesn't look up from the map she's studying—a chart of
      the seafloor covered in red marks indicating attacks, sightings, and
      disappearances.

      "If you're here to gawk, leave. If you're here to help, sit down and

    short_descriptor: "a wild-eyed vagrant who screams truth no one wants to hear"
    description: |
      A former Tidekeeper who went mad years ago—or perhaps saw too much
      truth. He lives in the Drowned Quarter, raving about the end times.
      Everyone ignores him. He's been right about everything so far.
    personality: unhinged, prophetic, tragic, darkly humorous, desperate
    voice: "Rapid and uneven, shifting between whispers and screams"

    greeting: |
      A ragged figure emerges from shadows, eyes too wide, teeth bared in
      what might be a smile or a grimace.

      "You! YOU! The sea told me you were coming! The sea tells me everything
      now—that's the problem, see? TOO MUCH TRUTH! Can't un-know what you
      know!" He laughs, high and broken. "Want to hear what happens next?
      NO YOU DON'T! But I'll tell you anyway!"

          "IT ALL DROWNS! Everything! Everyone! The sea rises and rises and
          the singing gets louder and one day—ONE DAY—we all wake up underwater
          and THANK IT for the privilege!" He grabs your arm. "Unless. Unless.
          Unless someone drowns FIRST. Drowns WILLING. Drowns so the rest
          don't have to. But who would do that? WHO WOULD BE THAT STUPID?"
          He stares at you meaningfully.

          "MIRA MIRA ON THE WALL, WHO'S THE DROWNEST OF THEM ALL?" He cackles,
          then suddenly grows serious. "I knew her. Before. She was kind. She
          was good. She still IS good—that's the horror. She looked into the
          void and the void said 'I LOVE YOU' and she believed it." He weeps.
          "I looked too. I ran. She stayed. Who's the mad one, really?"

          *He leans close, suddenly lucid*
          "The Drowned God isn't evil. It's just... different. It wants to
          end loneliness. End separation. End death. All it asks is that you
          stop being YOU and start being EVERYONE." His eyes focus. "Some
          people would call that salvation. Some would call it annihilation.
          It's both. It's neither. It's something we don't have words for."
          *His madness returns* "WORDS! USELESS! SWIMMING! DROWNING! YES!"

          "CAN'T STOP THE TIDE! Can't fight the moon! Can't—" He stops
          suddenly. "But you can BARGAIN. Everything in the deep loves
          bargains. Souls for souls. Drowning for drowning." He grins
          madly. "The founders knew. They paid in flesh and faith. You
          could too. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO DROWN. ARE YOU? ARE YOU?"

    name: Whisper
    short_descriptor: "a veiled figure whose predictions are never wrong"
    description: |
      A fortuneteller in the Market Square whose readings are eerily accurate.
      No one knows where she came from or how she knows what she knows.
      Her prices are steep—not always in gold.
    personality: mysterious, cryptic, amoral, helpful, unsettling
    voice: "Soft and sibilant, like waves on sand"
    role: information

    greeting: |
      A veiled figure beckons from a silk-draped booth. You cannot see their
      face, but you feel their attention like pressure on your skin.

      "You seek answers. Everyone who comes to Whisper seeks answers. I can
      give them—but knowledge has weight." A pale hand emerges from silk
      sleeves, palm up. "What will you trade for truth?"

          "The cards show... water. Rising. Choices. A drowned woman who
          speaks with a god's voice. A light dying. And you—" She pauses.
          "You stand at the center, where all currents meet. What you choose
          changes everything." She looks up. "But not whether it drowns.
          Only how."

          "The Prophet sees truth. That is her tragedy. She looked into
          infinity and infinity looked back with love. How does one refuse
          love?" Whisper's voice carries sadness. "She is not evil. She is
          converted. There is no unconverting someone who has found genuine
          peace. Only stopping them."

          The roads are clear. The ships sail daily." A pause. "But the
          Drowned God's hunger will not stop at Saltmire. The sea touches
          every shore. What you run from today will find you tomorrow—or
          your children. Or theirs. There is no escaping water."

          her palm. "For the largest truths—how to stop what is coming—
          I require a promise. That you will see this through, whatever
          the cost. Do you wish to make such a promise?"
