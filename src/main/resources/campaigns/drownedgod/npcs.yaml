  - id: prophet_mira
    name: Prophet Mira
    short_descriptor: "a woman whose eyes hold the depths of the sea"
    description: |
      Once the most beloved oracle in Saltmire, Prophet Mira descended into the
      deepest ruins three weeks ago and returned... changed. She speaks with a
      voice that echoes, moves as if underwater even on dry land, and her eyes
      reflect things that shouldn't exist. She genuinely believes she is saving
      humanity from a worse fate. She may even be right.
    personality: serene, maternal, terrifying, sympathetic, absolutely certain
    voice: "Layered and echoing, as if many voices speak in perfect unison. Warm but unsettling."
    role: main_villain

    greeting: |
      The Prophet turns to face you, and for a moment—just a moment—you see
      something vast and ancient looking out through her eyes.

      "Ah. You've come." Her smile is warm. Her voice resonates in your chest.
      "I've been watching you. The sea shows me things now. It showed me you.
      It showed me what you might become... if you're brave enough to let go."

        response: |
          "The sea is not cruel. It simply is. It takes, yes—but it also gives.
          Shelter from the burning sky. Peace from the chaos above. Connection
          to something greater than ourselves." Her eyes grow distant. "I heard
          it calling for so long before I finally answered. The silence. The
          belonging. You hear it too, don't you? In the quiet moments?"

        response: |
          "God is a human word for something beyond human understanding. What
          sleeps beneath Saltmire is not a god—it is a possibility. A way of
          being. It fell from the stars eons ago and found the ocean welcoming.
          It does not want worship." She tilts her head. "It wants connection.
          Union. An end to the loneliness of individual existence. Is that
          so terrible?"

      her_transformation:
        keywords: [changed, different, transformation, what happened to you]
        response: |
          "I touched it. Just once. Just for a moment." Her voice softens.
          "And I understood everything. The fear, the struggle, the desperate
          clinging to separate existence—all of it unnecessary. There is peace
          in the depths. There is belonging." She reaches toward you, and you
          notice her fingers have begun to web. "I want to share that peace
          with everyone. Is that not what prophets do?"

        response: |
          *She looks at you with something like pity*
          "You could try. Others have. But you cannot fight the tide—only
          delay it. And every moment you delay, more people suffer alone in
          their separate skins." She sighs. "I was afraid too, once. But fear
          is just another form of drowning—slower and more cruel. Let me show
          you a better way."

      bargain:
        keywords: [deal, bargain, negotiate, compromise, agreement]
        response: |
          *Her eyes flicker with something ancient*
          "The deep remembers all bargains. The nobles of the Abyssal Court
          learned this long ago—and have prospered for it. You could join them.
          Serve the rising tide and be spared its worst... or stand against it
          and drown in the old way." She smiles. "There are no neutral parties
          in the sea. Only the swimming and the sinking."

      Former salvage diver turned tavern keeper. Lost his eye—and his crew—
      to something in the depths twenty years ago. He knows more about what's

    role: ally

    greeting: |
      The old sailor looks up from his glass, his one good eye narrowing.

      "New faces. That's rare these days—most folk are leaving, not arriving."
      He gestures to a seat. "Sit. Drink. And tell me what brings you to a

          He drinks. "The tides rise higher each night. Folk are disappearing.
          And that singing you hear at night? Don't listen. Don't ever listen."

          wanted." He touches his eyepatch. "I was the only one who said no.

          who pays, but be careful—Guildmaster Vex has made bargains of her
          own." He leans in. "There might be a way to seal it back up. The

          to drown. But I've been drowning in guilt for twenty years, and
          I'm still here fighting." He meets your eye. "The future isn't
          written. It's earned. Now finish your drink and go earn it."

      The most powerful merchant in Saltmire. She's made the Salvage Guild

    greeting: |
      The Guildmaster looks up from a ledger filled with numbers that seem
      to writhe on the page.

      "New contractors? Or just tourists?" Her smile is sharp. "Either way,
      you're in the right place. The Guild can provide anything you need—
      information, equipment, access to the ruins. All it costs is gold.
      And occasionally, other things."

    greeting: |
      The Commander doesn't look up from the map she's studying—a chart of
      the seafloor covered in red marks indicating attacks, sightings, and
      disappearances.

      "If you're here to gawk, leave. If you're here to help, sit down and

          might be a smile. They place a webbed hand over their heart,
          then gesture expansively at everything around them—the water,
          the darkness, the depths. Their eyes hold no fear. No regret.
          No resistance. Whether that's peace or emptiness, you cannot tell.
