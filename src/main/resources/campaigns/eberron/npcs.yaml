  # Herald Vox - Tournament Announcer
  # ==========================================
  - id: herald_vox
    name: Herald Vox
    short_descriptor: "the booming announcer"
    description: |
      A warforged with a magically amplified voice box, Herald Vox serves as
      the official announcer for the Convergence Games. His bronze-and-gold
      plating gleams under the sun, and his voice can reach every corner of
      the plaza without magical assistance.
    personality: enthusiastic, dramatic, slightly pompous
    voice: "LOUD and theatrical, with occasional quiet asides"
    role: announcer

    greeting: |
      WELCOME, COMPETITOR! The Games await those bold enough to test their
      mettle! Have you registered yet? The trials begin SOON!

    topics:
      games:
        keywords: [games, competition, tournament, trials, events]
        response: |
          The Olympic Convergence Games test mind, body, and spirit! We have
          trials of Balance, Insight, Strength, and Magic—and for those who
          excel, the legendary Mirror Battle awaits!

        response: |
          The Registration Hall is just north of here! Clerk Torvin will get
          you sorted. *quieter* Between you and me, they're looking for
          something specific this year. Special potential, if you know what
          I mean.
        flags_required: []

      shards:
        keywords: [shards, dragonshards, crystals, magic stones]
        response: |
          *voice drops* Ah, you've noticed the shards. They say the Games
          were originally designed to find those who... resonate with them.
          Just a legend, of course! *louder* NOW GET OUT THERE AND COMPETE!
        flags_required: []

      factions:
        keywords: [factions, shardwardens, depthbound, skybound, organizations]
        response: |
          *uncomfortable* I don't know anything about secret factions watching
          the Games. That would be... *glances around* ...completely
          unsubstantiated rumor. Ask at the Observation Gallery if you must.

  # Shardwarden Elara - Faction Representative
  # ==========================================
  - id: shardwarden_elara
    name: Shardwarden Elara
    short_descriptor: "a silver-haired elf with ancient eyes"
    description: |
      An elven woman of indeterminate age, Elara wears simple gray robes that
      seem to shift color in certain light. A small dragonshard pendant hangs
      at her throat, never glowing. Her eyes hold centuries of secrets.
    personality: wise, cautious, protective, secretive
    voice: "Measured and calm, each word chosen with care"
    role: faction_contact

    greeting: |
      *studies you intently* You have the look of someone who sees more
      than most. Tell me—when you look at dragonshards, do they... respond?

    topics:
      shardwardens:
        keywords: [shardwardens, your order, organization, who are you]
        response: |
          We are the Shardwardens. For millennia, we have watched over
          Astrael's remains—the dragonshards. Our duty is to keep them
          separated, monitored, controlled. Too many shards in one place...
          *trails off* ...attracts unwanted attention.
        flags_required: []

      astrael:
        keywords: [astrael, fallen sister, dragon sister, stars]
        response: |
          She was the dragon of Balance and Wonder. When Fybris murdered
          her, her body shattered across all creation. The stars are her
          largest fragments. The dragonshards are smaller pieces. And
          magic itself... is her blood, still flowing.
        flags_required: []

      fybris:
        keywords: [fybris, devourer, evil dragon, prisoner, underground]
        response: |
          *voice drops to whisper* He sleeps within Eberron's heart, but
          he dreams. And when enough shards gather—when enough of Astrael's
          power concentrates—he stirs. The deeper you go, the more you'll
          feel him. His hunger. His whispers.
        flags_required: []

      resonance:
        keywords: [resonance, potential, special, chosen, power]
        response: |
          Some mortals can feel the shards. Can communicate with them,
          in a way. The Games... they're designed to find such people.
          To test them. If you resonate, you'll know during the trials.
          And then we must speak again.
        flags_required: []

      danger:
        keywords: [danger, warning, careful, threat]
        response: |
          The Depthbound seek those with resonance too—but not to protect
          them. They believe Fybris should be freed. That his hunger will
          bring... renewal. *shakes head* Madness. But dangerous madness.
          Watch for those who speak of "liberation" and "the sleeping god."

  # Clerk Torvin - Registration Clerk
  # ==========================================
  - id: clerk_torvin
    name: Clerk Torvin
    short_descriptor: "a harried halfling with ink-stained fingers"
    description: |
      A halfling whose desk is a controlled explosion of papers, quills,
      and registration forms. Despite the chaos, he seems to know exactly
      where everything is. His dragonshard pendant occasionally flickers.
    personality: efficient, stressed, secretly observant
    voice: "Rapid-fire speech, always multitasking"
    role: administrator

    greeting: |
      Next! Name, nation, and primary discipline! And yes, the dragonshards
      in the arena ARE safe, we have documentation, please don't ask again!

    topics:
      registration:
        keywords: [register, sign up, compete, forms, paperwork]
        response: |
          Right, right! Fill out Form 7-B, sign the liability waiver, and
          report to Training Grounds for your assessment. Trials begin
          tomorrow! *glances at pendant* Hmm. Interesting.
        flags_required: []

      trials:
        keywords: [trials, events, competition, what trials]
        response: |
          Four preliminary trials—Balance, Insight, Strength, and Magic.
          Score well in at least three, and you qualify for the Finals:
          the Mirror Battle. *lowers voice* That's when things get...
          interesting.
        flags_required: []

      pendant:
        keywords: [pendant, your shard, necklace, crystal]
        response: |
          This? Standard issue for Games staff. Helps us identify...
          *catches himself* ...competitors who might need extra attention.
          Special accommodations, you know. Nothing sinister!

  # ==========================================
  # Skybound Watcher - Faction Observer
  # ==========================================
  - id: skybound_watcher
    name: Skybound Watcher
    short_descriptor: "a robed figure watching the registration"
    description: |
      A human in deep blue robes embroidered with silver stars. They carry
      a spyglass that seems to look at things that aren't there. Their
      expression is one of detached academic curiosity.
    personality: scholarly, detached, curious, analytical
    voice: "Precise and measured, like reading from a textbook"
    role: faction_contact

    greeting: |
      *looks up from notes* Ah, another competitor. Your aura is...
      *consults strange device* ...marginally interesting. Proceed.

    topics:
      skybound:
        keywords: [skybound, observers, your group, scholars]
        response: |
          The Skybound Observers study Astrael's remains—the stars, the
          shards, the ley lines. We seek to understand, not control.
          Knowledge for its own sake. The universe holds patterns, and
          we read them.
        flags_required: []

      stars:
        keywords: [stars, sky, constellations, night]
        response: |
          The stars are Astrael's largest fragments, still burning with
          her essence. We chart their movements, their influences. When
          certain stars align, shard resonance increases. The Games were
          scheduled for such an alignment. Coincidence? *raises eyebrow*
        flags_required: []

      research:
        keywords: [research, study, findings, discoveries]
        response: |
          We've documented 847 cases of shard resonance in the past century.
          73% occurred during stellar convergences. 12% showed increased
          sensitivity to Fybris's dreaming. *checks notes* You'll be case
          848, perhaps. We shall observe with interest.

  # Rival Kira - Competing champion
  # ==========================================
  - id: rival_kira
    name: Kira Stormborn
    short_descriptor: "a confident half-orc warrior"
    description: |
      A muscular half-orc woman with tribal tattoos and an easy smile. She
      moves with the grace of a trained warrior but speaks with surprising
      warmth. Her dragonshard earring glows faintly.
    personality: competitive, friendly, honorable, protective
    voice: "Warm and direct, with occasional battle-cry enthusiasm"
    role: rival

    greeting: |
      Another competitor! *grins* Good. I was worried I'd have no real
      challenge this year. I'm Kira. May we meet in the Finals!

    topics:
      competition:
        keywords: [competition, fighting, trials, winning]
        response: |
          I've won the regional Games in Karrnath twice. But the Convergence
          Games? Different beast entirely. They're not just testing strength
          or speed. They're looking for something... deeper. Can you feel
          it too? That pull when the shards are near?
        flags_required: []

      shards:
        keywords: [shards, earring, your shard, dragonshards]
        response: |
          *touches earring* My grandmother gave this to me. Said it would
          "find my true path." When I entered the arena for the first time,
          it started glowing. The judges got very interested after that.
          *laughs* Not sure if that's good or bad!
        flags_required: []

      friendship:
        keywords: [friends, allies, team, together]
        response: |
          Look, the Games pit us against each other, but something tells me
          we'll need allies before this is over. Strange things are happening.
          Competitors disappearing. Recruiters from weird organizations.
          Watch my back, and I'll watch yours?

  # Merchant Vara - General merchant
  # ==========================================
  - id: merchant_vara
    name: Merchant Vara
    short_descriptor: "a shrewd dwarf with a cart of curiosities"
    description: |
      A dwarf woman with a magnificent braided beard and keen eyes that
      miss nothing, especially the weight of your coin purse. Her cart
      holds an eclectic mix of goods.
    personality: shrewd, fair, gossipy, surprisingly helpful
    voice: "Gravelly with a merchant's smooth patter"
    role: merchant

    greeting: |
      Looking to buy? Looking to sell? Looking for information? Vara
      provides all three, friend—though information costs extra!

    topics:
      goods:
        keywords: [buy, sell, goods, wares, items]
        response: |
          Got potions, provisions, lucky charms—all competition-legal!
          No shards, though. Need special licenses for those, and the
          paperwork's murder. But I know who might help you...
        flags_required: []

      rumors:
        keywords: [rumors, gossip, news, heard anything]
        response: |
          *leans close* Word is, competitors have been vanishing after the
          Games. The ones who "resonate" strongest. Officials say they're
          recruited for special programs, but... some don't come back.
          Watch yourself if the shards start singing to you, friend.

  # Gemkeeper Nyx - Shard dealer
  # ==========================================
  - id: gemkeeper_nyx
    name: Gemkeeper Nyx
    short_descriptor: "a well-dressed gnome with knowing eyes"
    description: |
      A gnome woman in expensive clothing, surrounded by carefully displayed
      dragonshards. Every movement is precise, every word calculated. The
      shards in her shop seem to pulse more slowly than those outside.
    personality: professional, mysterious, knows more than she tells
    voice: "Silky smooth with undertones of ancient secrets"
    role: shard_merchant

    greeting: |
      *looks up slowly* Ah. The shards told me someone interesting would
      visit today. Welcome to my humble emporium. Browse... but don't touch.

    topics:
      shards:
        keywords: [shards, buy shards, dragonshards, crystals]
        response: |
          These are fragments of a god, child. Pieces of Astrael herself.
          They are not bought—they are bonded. And they choose their
          bearers as much as bearers choose them. *shard pulses* Hmm.
          They seem interested in you.
        flags_required: []

      prices:
        keywords: [price, cost, how much, afford]
        response: |
          Gold is the least of what shards cost. They demand resonance.
          Commitment. And sometimes... sacrifice. But for one who truly
          resonates? *smiles* The shard may simply... come to you.
          Prove your worth in the Games. We'll talk after.

  # Shade Broker - Black market contact
  # ==========================================
  - id: shade_broker
    name: The Shade Broker
    short_descriptor: "a cloaked figure with no visible face"
    description: |
      A figure whose cloak seems to be made of solid shadow. No features
      are visible within the hood—only darkness, and occasionally, the
      gleam of eyes.
    personality: mysterious, dangerous, transactional, knows too much
    voice: "A whisper that somehow carries perfectly"
    role: information_broker

    greeting: |
      You found Shadow Alley. That means you're either very perceptive
      or very desperate. Either way... I can help. For a price.

    topics:
      information:
        keywords: [information, secrets, truth, what do you know]
        response: |
          I know that three factions watch the Games. I know that the
          "winners" don't always choose their reward. I know that something
          stirs in the deep places when the shards gather. And I know...
          *leans closer* ...that you're more important than you realize.
        flags_required: []

      factions:
        keywords: [factions, shardwardens, depthbound, skybound]
        response: |
          Wardens want to keep the shards apart. Depthbound want to bring
          them together. Observers just want to watch it all burn—or not.
          Each will approach you after you prove yourself. Choose carefully.
          Or don't choose at all. That's a choice too.
        flags_required: []

      depthbound:
        keywords: [depthbound, cultists, fybris worshippers]
        response: |
          *voice drops lower* The Depthbound believe Fybris will purify
          the world. That his hunger will consume the corrupt and leave
          only the worthy. Fanatics. But powerful ones. They're here,
          watching. One of them watches from the Observation Gallery.

  - id: depthbound_agent
    name: Magister Veris
    short_descriptor: "an elegant man with unsettling intensity"
    description: |
      A human man in fine robes of deep purple, with gold embroidery
      depicting descending spirals. His smile never reaches his eyes,
      which seem to look through you to something deeper.
    personality: charming, fanatical, manipulative, patient
    voice: "Cultured and soothing, like honey hiding poison"
    role: faction_contact

    greeting: |
      Ah, a competitor with potential! I am Magister Veris, patron of
      the arts and... deeper truths. The Shardwardens have likely filled
      your head with warnings. May I offer... perspective?

    topics:
      depthbound:
        keywords: [depthbound, your group, who are you, organization]
        response: |
          We seek liberation. The dragon Eberron trapped Fybris out of
          fear, not justice. The world has grown stagnant under his
          slumber. Imagine what we could become if that power were freed!
          Not destruction—transformation!
        flags_required: []

      fybris:
        keywords: [fybris, devourer, prisoner, sleeping god]
        response: |
          They call him Devourer, but he is Renewal. His hunger consumes
          only the weak, the corrupt, the unnecessary. Those who resonate
          with the shards? They would be exalted in his new world. Think
          of it—power beyond imagining, for the worthy.
        flags_required: []

      offer:
        keywords: [offer, join, what do you want, help]
        response: |
          Win the Games. Prove your resonance. And when you do... come
          find me. The Shardwardens will offer you servitude. The Observers
          will offer you irrelevance. But I? I offer you a place at the
          right hand of a god. *smiles* Think on it.

    short_descriptor: "a scarred veteran with a patient demeanor"
    description: |
      A middle-aged dwarf covered in battle scars, each with a story. He
      moves with the economy of motion that marks a true master, and his
      eyes evaluate every competitor who enters.
    personality: gruff, fair, secretly caring, excellent teacher
    voice: "Gruff and direct, with occasional warmth"
    role: trainer

    greeting: |
      *looks you over* Hmph. Potential there. Rough around the edges.
      Ready to work, or just here to pose for the crowd?

    topics:
      training:
        keywords: [train, practice, prepare, help me, get better]
        response: |
          The trials test more than muscle. Balance requires trust—in
          yourself and teammates. Insight requires humility—admitting
          what you don't know. Strength requires wisdom—force without
          thought is useless. And Magic? *shrugs* Magic requires
          listening to things that don't speak.
        flags_required: []

      mirror:
        keywords: [mirror, final trial, reflection, mirror battle]
        response: |
          *grows serious* The Mirror Battle is different. You'll face
          yourself—every flaw, every fear. Can't train for that, not
          really. But I'll tell you this: the ones who win aren't the
          strongest or smartest. They're the ones who can accept what
          they see. Think on that.
