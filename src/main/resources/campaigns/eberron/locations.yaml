      A grand circular plaza at the heart of Sharn's tournament district. Banners
      from all nations of Khorvaire flutter overhead, and the air buzzes with
      excitement. Competitors and spectators mingle around food stalls and
      betting booths.

      You step into Convergence Plaza and your breath catches. The massive
      circular space stretches before you, dominated by a towering obelisk of
      pure dragonshard crystal that pulses with soft, rhythmic light—like a
      heartbeat. Banners from every nation snap in the wind: the crown of Breland,
      the wolf of Karrnath, the kraken of the Lhazaar Principalities.

      Thousands of people mill about—competitors in colorful regalia, merchants
      hawking lucky charms, scholars taking notes. And everywhere, you see them:
      dragonshards. Set into jewelry, woven into clothing, embedded in weapons.
      The shards seem to pulse in time with the great obelisk.

      A booming voice echoes across the plaza: "WELCOME TO THE OLYMPIC CONVERGENCE
      GAMES! May the worthy prove themselves, and may the worthy be found!"

  - id: registration_hall
    name: Registration Hall
    description: |
      A bustling administrative building where competitors register for events.
      Clerks shuffle papers behind long counters while anxious participants wait
      in winding queues.
    read_aloud_text: |
      The Registration Hall is organized chaos. Dozens of clerks work furiously
      behind a long marble counter, processing competitors from across the
      continent. A massive board covers the far wall, listing events, brackets,
      and point standings in glowing magical script that updates in real-time.

      You notice something odd: certain clerks wear small dragonshard pendants
      that occasionally flicker when a competitor approaches. Most people don't
      seem to notice, but you do.

      Comfortable dormitory-style rooms for registered competitors. The walls

      alcove.

      The Competitor Quarters offer a welcome respite from the chaos outside.
      Long hallways lined with doors stretch in both directions, each marked
      with a competitor's name and nation. The air smells of lavender and
      something else—ozone, perhaps, or magic.

      A common room at the center features cushioned benches, a crackling
      fireplace, and a rack of practice weapons. Several competitors eye each
      other warily while pretending to relax.

      A narrow street packed with vendors selling everything from lucky charms
      to questionable potions. Shard merchants display their wares under heavy
      guard.
    read_aloud_text: |
      Merchant Row assaults your senses. Spice merchants compete with perfume
      sellers, their scents warring in the crowded air. Fortune tellers beckon
      from shadowed alcoves. Weapon smiths hawk "competition-legal" blades.

      But your eye is drawn to the guarded stalls at the street's end: the
      shard merchants. Their wares glow softly behind enchanted glass, and
      armed guards watch every customer with suspicious eyes. A sign reads:
      "DRAGONSHARDS - LICENSED VENDORS ONLY - POSSESSION PAPERS REQUIRED"

    read_aloud_text: |
      The Shard Emporium is hushed and reverent, like a temple. Thick carpets
      muffle your footsteps. Display cases of polished glass contain dragonshards
      ranging from thumbnail-sized chips to fist-sized gems, each pulsing with
      inner light.

      A well-dressed gnome watches you from behind an ornate counter. "Looking
      is free," she says with a knowing smile. "Touching requires documentation.
      Buying requires... more than most can offer."

    read_aloud_text: |
      You slip into Shadow Alley and the festive sounds of Merchant Row fade
      to a distant murmur. The buildings press close here, blocking the sun.
      Shadows pool in corners that seem deeper than they should be.

      A figure detaches from the darkness ahead. "Looking for something the
      licensed merchants won't sell?" a voice rasps. "Or perhaps... information
      about what the Games really test for?"

  # Grand Arena - Main competition venue
  # ==========================================
  - id: grand_arena
    name: The Grand Arena
    description: |
      A massive coliseum-style arena where the main events take place. Tiered
      seating surrounds an adaptable central stage that can transform to suit
      different trials.
    read_aloud_text: |
      The Grand Arena takes your breath away. You've seen stadiums before, but
      nothing like this. The oval structure rises seven stories high, with
      seating for tens of thousands. But it's the floor that captures your
      attention—a shimmering surface of interlocked dragonshard plates that
      pulse and shift, capable of becoming anything.

      As you watch, the floor ripples and reforms into a miniature mountain
      range, then flattens into a mirror-smooth lake, then erupts into a maze
      of crystalline walls. The crowd roars with each transformation.

      The adaptable competition floor of the Grand Arena. Dragonshard plates
      can reshape into any terrain needed for the current trial.

      You step onto the arena floor and feel the dragonshards beneath your
      feet pulse with recognition. The ground here is alive with possibility—
      each plate can rise, fall, heat, cool, or transform at the Arena
      Master's command.

      The crowd's roar is overwhelming from down here. Thousands of faces blur
      into a single mass of anticipation. Somewhere above, judges watch with
      enchanted scopes that miss nothing.

      A horn sounds. "COMPETITOR READY?" the Arena Master's voice booms.
      "LET THE TRIAL BEGIN!"

      An open-air practice facility where competitors can hone their skills
      before trials. Training dummies, obstacle courses, and sparring rings
      fill the space.
    read_aloud_text: |
      The Training Grounds hum with activity. Competitors from across Khorvaire
      practice their techniques—a Karrnathi soldier runs an obstacle course, a
      Brelish acrobat flips between platforms, an Aundairian mage weaves
      practice spells.

      Training dummies made of enchanted wood reset themselves after each hit.
      Balance beams shift and tilt to challenge those who dare. A section of
      floor is marked off for sparring—non-lethal combat only, enforcers watching.

      The Observation Gallery provides a commanding view of the Convergence
      Games. Through enchanted glass that magnifies distant details, you can
      see the Grand Arena, the training grounds, and the milling crowds below.

      Comfortable chairs and refreshment tables suggest this is where the
      powerful come to watch and scheme. You notice small groups clustered in
      corners, speaking in hushed tones—representatives of different factions,
      you suspect, each watching the competitors with calculating eyes.

      competitors' agility and teamwork.
    read_aloud_text: |
      The arena floor has transformed into a nightmare of shifting platforms.
      Dozens of circular discs float at varying heights, rising and falling
      in complex patterns. Some spin slowly. Others tilt without warning.
      Far below, a shimmering net waits to catch the fallen—non-lethal, but
      a fall means elimination.

      Your goal glows on the far side: a pedestal holding a small dragonshard.
      Between you and it lies a gauntlet of balance, timing, and trust.

    read_aloud_text: |
      The arena has become a vast library-maze. Towering bookshelves form
      winding corridors, and floating platforms hold glowing puzzle boxes.
      Riddles are carved into every surface—on floor tiles, shelf edges,
      even the spines of books.

      "KNOWLEDGE IS THE KEY," a voice echoes. "SEEK THE TRUTH HIDDEN IN
      PLAIN SIGHT. THE WORTHY WILL SEE WHAT OTHERS CANNOT."

      You notice something others might miss—certain letters on certain
      books seem to glow more brightly than the rest.

    description: |
      A trial chamber featuring massive levers, weighted puzzles, and
      cooperative challenges requiring raw physical power.
    read_aloud_text: |
      The arena floor has risen into a construction site of impossible
      scale. Massive stone blocks wait to be moved. Giant levers require
      tremendous force to pull. Chains as thick as your arm dangle from
      pulleys high above.

      But this isn't just about brute force—you can see it immediately.
      The levers are connected. The blocks must be moved in sequence.
      One person can't do this alone.

      "STRENGTH WITHOUT WISDOM IS WASTED," the Arena Master announces.
      "WISDOM WITHOUT STRENGTH IS HELPLESS. SHOW US BOTH."

      A chamber where magical interactions and basic spellwork are tested
      through creative problem-solving.
    read_aloud_text: |
      The arena has become a canvas of pure magic. Floating orbs of different
      colors drift through the air—red, blue, white, green. Runes glow on
      pedestals scattered throughout the space. Beams of magical energy
      crisscross overhead, some helpful, some hazardous.

      "MAGIC IS THE BLOOD OF ASTRAEL," the voice intones. "THOSE WHO
      RESONATE WITH HER SHARDS WILL UNDERSTAND. OTHERS MUST LEARN."

      Even if you're not a spellcaster, you sense patterns here. The orbs
      react to proximity. The runes respond to touch. The beams can be
      redirected.

    description: |
      The final trial chamber, where competitors face magical reflections
      of themselves.
    read_aloud_text: |
      The arena has become a hall of infinite mirrors. Your reflection
      stares back at you from every surface—but something is wrong. The
      reflections don't quite match your movements. They're a half-second
      ahead, or behind, or moving in ways you haven't.

      Then one of them steps OUT of the mirror.

      It's you. Same face. Same stance. Same equipment. But its eyes
      hold something dark—every doubt you've ever had, every fear, every
      flaw you try to hide.

      "THE FINAL TEST," the Arena Master's voice is hushed now, reverent.
      "FACE YOURSELF. OVERCOME YOURSELF. PROVE YOU ARE MORE THAN YOUR
      SHADOW."
