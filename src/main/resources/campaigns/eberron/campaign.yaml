intro: |
  Long before kingdoms, before magic schools, before war, three cosmic dragons
  and a god shaped existence itself.

  One dragon became the world.
  One dragon became the sky.
  One dragon became the prisoner.
  And their shattered sister became power.

  At the dawn of everything, a god known only as The First Spark shaped three
  dragon siblings to help create the universe. EBERRON, the Guardian, loved the
  world so fiercely she became it—her body the mountains and seas, her breath
  the wind itself. FYBRIS, the Devourer, whose hunger knew no bounds, killed
  their sister and was imprisoned deep within Eberron's earthen heart. And
  ASTRAEL, the Fallen Sister, dragon of Balance, Wonder, and Possibility—her
  body shattered across creation, becoming the stars, the dragonshards, and
  magic as mortals know it.

  Now, the Olympic Convergence Games have come to the great city of Sharn.
  Champions from across Khorvaire gather to compete—to celebrate peace, to test
  talent, to scout heroes.

  But ancient factions watch from the shadows, seeking those with shard resonance.
  The Games are designed to awaken dormant potential.

  You feel it, don't you? That strange pull when you see the dragonshards glow.
  That sense that something ancient is stirring.

  The deeper you go into the world, the closer you get to the truth—and to
  something that should never wake.

  Welcome to the Games.

  CORE THEME: "The deeper you go, the darker it gets."

  Surface: politics, magic, intrigue
  Underground: ancient ruins, madness, corruption
  Deep World: prisons, cosmic horror, Fybris' influence

  THE WORLD IS ALIVE:
  - Mountains = bone ridges
  - Ley lines = veins
  - Volcanoes = wounds
  - The deep earth = Eberron's stomach, where Fybris is chained

  TONE PROGRESSION:
  - Sessions 1-2: Fun, competitive, puzzle-based, no lethal combat
  - Mid-campaign: Mystery, faction intrigue, first hints of darkness
  - Late campaign: Cosmic horror, difficult choices, sacrifice

  SHARD MECHANIC WARNING:
  The more shards a party collects, the more Fybris notices them.

  VICTORY CONDITIONS (Final Boss):
  Fybris is NOT meant to be fought directly. Winning means:
  - Re-sealing him
  - Bargaining with him
  - Sacrifice
  - Or choosing what kind of world survives

  THEMES:
  - Power has consequences
  - Knowledge changes people
  - The world protects you—but it's dying
  - Heroes are chosen by choice, not destiny
