    entry_narrative: |
      The arena floor transforms before your eyes. Dozens of circular platforms
      rise from the ground, floating at varying heights. Some spin slowly. Others
      tilt without warning. Far below, a shimmering net waits to catch the fallen.

      "COMPETITORS!" the Arena Master's voice booms. "The Trial of Balance tests
      not just your body, but your trust—in yourself and your teammates. Cross
      the platforms. Reach the shard. Do not fall."

      The crowd falls silent. A single dragonshard glows on a pedestal at the
      far end of the course.

    stinger: |
      As you claim the Medal of Balance, you feel something strange—a warmth
      spreading from the dragonshard you passed. Did it... pulse in time with
      your heartbeat? The judges exchange knowing glances, marking something
      on their enchanted clipboards.

  # Trial #2: Trial of Insight

  # ==========================================
  - id: trial_insight
    name: "Trial of Insight"
    location_id: insight_chamber

    entry_narrative: |
      The arena becomes a vast library-maze. Towering bookshelves form winding
      corridors, and floating platforms hold glowing puzzle boxes. Riddles are
      carved into every surface—on floor tiles, shelf edges, even book spines.

      "KNOWLEDGE IS THE KEY," a voice intones. "SEEK THE TRUTH HIDDEN IN PLAIN
      SIGHT. THE WORTHY WILL SEE WHAT OTHERS CANNOT."

      You notice something others might miss—certain letters on certain books
      seem to glow more brightly than the rest. A pattern is forming.

    stinger: |
      The Medal of Insight settles around your neck, and suddenly the world
      seems... sharper. Colors are more vivid. You notice details you missed
      before. And in the corner of your eye, you could swear you see the
      dragonshards throughout the arena pulsing in a deliberate pattern.

  # ==========================================
  # Trial #3: Trial of Strength
  # Location: Chamber of Strength
  # ==========================================
  - id: trial_strength
    name: "Trial of Strength"
    location_id: strength_chamber

    entry_narrative: |
      The arena floor rises into a construction site of impossible scale. Massive
      stone blocks wait to be moved. Giant levers require tremendous force to
      pull. Chains as thick as your arm dangle from pulleys high above.

      But this isn't just about brute force—you can see it immediately. The
      levers are connected. The blocks must be moved in sequence. One person
      can't do this alone.

      "STRENGTH WITHOUT WISDOM IS WASTED," the Arena Master announces.
      "WISDOM WITHOUT STRENGTH IS HELPLESS. SHOW US BOTH."

    completion_reward: strength_medal
    completion_reward_text: "Medal of Strength"

    stinger: |
      You feel stronger than when you started—not just in body, but in purpose.
      The Medal of Strength hums against your chest. You notice that other
      competitors who completed this trial move differently now, as if aware
      of burdens they didn't carry before.

  # ==========================================
  # Trial #4: Trial of Magic
  # Location: Chamber of Magic
  # ==========================================
  - id: trial_magic
    name: "Trial of Magic"
    location_id: magic_chamber

    entry_narrative: |
      The arena becomes a canvas of pure magic. Floating orbs of different
      colors drift through the air—red, blue, white, green. Runes glow on
      pedestals scattered throughout the space. Beams of magical energy
      crisscross overhead, some helpful, some hazardous.

      "MAGIC IS THE BLOOD OF ASTRAEL," the voice intones. "THOSE WHO RESONATE
      WITH HER SHARDS WILL UNDERSTAND. OTHERS MUST LEARN."

      Even if you're not a spellcaster, you sense patterns here. The orbs
      react to proximity. The runes respond to touch. The beams can be
      redirected.

    stinger: |
      As you complete the trial, every dragonshard in the arena flares
      brightly—just for a moment. The crowd gasps. The judges lean forward.
      You feel a connection now, a thread of awareness linking you to
      something vast and ancient. Somewhere, something has noticed you.

  # ==========================================
  # Trial #5: Mirror Battle (Finals)
  # Location: Chamber of Mirrors
  # ==========================================
  - id: trial_mirror
    name: "The Mirror Battle"
    location_id: mirror_chamber

    entry_narrative: |
      The arena has become a hall of infinite mirrors. Your reflection stares
      back at you from every surface—but something is wrong. The reflections
      don't quite match your movements. They're a half-second ahead, or behind,
      or moving in ways you haven't.

      Then one of them steps OUT of the mirror.

      It's you. Same face. Same stance. Same equipment. But its eyes hold
      something dark—every doubt you've ever had, every fear, every flaw
      you try to hide.

      "THE FINAL TEST," the Arena Master's voice is hushed now, reverent.
      "FACE YOURSELF. OVERCOME YOURSELF. PROVE YOU ARE MORE THAN YOUR SHADOW."

    completion_reward: champions_shard
    completion_reward_text: "Champion's Shard"

    stinger: |
      Your reflection dissolves into light—not defeated, but accepted. The
      light gathers into your hands and crystallizes into a dragonshard unlike
      any other. It formed from YOU. From your acceptance of yourself.

      The crowd is silent. Even the judges seem shaken.

      A silver-haired elf in gray robes—Shardwarden Elara—appears at the arena's
      edge. "It seems," she says quietly, "that we need to talk. The Games were
      designed to find people like you. And now... others will be looking too."
